Sure! Here’s a fun and engaging icebreaker game you can play at the beginning of a meeting called “Two Truths and a Lie.” It’s great for building rapport and adding a bit of light-hearted fun to your meeting.

Game: Two Truths and a Lie
Objective: Get to know your teammates better in a fun and engaging way.

How to Play:

Setup: Inform each participant that they will need to think of two truths and one lie about themselves. The lie should be plausible to make the game challenging and interesting.
Round Robin: Each participant takes a turn to share their three statements (two truths and one lie) in a random order without revealing which is which.
Guessing: After a participant shares their statements, the rest of the team has to guess which one they think is the lie. You can have a show of hands for each statement or simply shout out guesses.
Reveal: The participant reveals which statement was the lie and can briefly elaborate on their truths, if they wish.
Scoring (Optional): You can keep it non-competitive or add a scoring element where participants earn points for each correct guess. The person with the most points at the end could get a small prize or just the glory of being the most insightful guesser!
Benefits: This game not only lightens the mood but also provides insights into the lives and experiences of your colleagues, which can strengthen team bonds and enhance communication.

Tip: Encourage creativity and fun! The more creative the truths and the lie, the more fun the game becomes. Plus, it often leads to spontaneous storytelling, laughter, and deeper conversations.

This icebreaker requires no physical materials, suits any group size, and is perfect for both in-person and virtual meetings. Enjoy breaking the ice!
