Tell us about a time when you had to think outside the box to complete a tas. Were you successful?
While I was a CDL instructor at a school, I immediately discovered a list of safety issues that I had to take ownership of. I came up with ideas to remediate the concern and called the owner to provide insight into the matter. I also came up with a more effective method of completing the alley dock exam by breaking down a larger step into a set of gitsmaller ones and creating reasonable diagrams for students to master the maneuver.

As a leader, how would you persuade people to do what you want?
I would emphasize the shared vision and goals we are working towards, highlighting the benefits and positive impact of the desired actions on both individual and collective success. I would also collaborate with the team to find solutions that align with our shared objectives, promoting a sense of ownership and commitment to the task at hand.
